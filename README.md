## P01 Notes: 
#### Find our schedules for the first checkpoint demo in master. Files are titled as Schedule_Namaswi, Schedule_Reena, Schedule_Sharan

#### Find our feature tickets on JIRA (Invitation sent to TA)
Jira is a proprietary issue tracking product developed by Atlassian which allows bug tracking and agile project management.

We have groomed and planned the features for 1 week sprints, assigning points based on man hours that the task is expected to take. We have also assigned these tasks to ourselves.
#### You can find the other tasks in the backlog: https://sheepbaboons.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=SHEEP&rapidView=1&view=planning
