#### Find our feature and future bug tickets on JIRA (Invitation sent to TA)
Jira is a proprietary issue tracking system that we are using for tracking our feature development, tasks and bugs. We have groomed and planned the features for the first sprint, assigning points based on man hours that the task is expected to take. We have also assigned these tasks to ourselves.
